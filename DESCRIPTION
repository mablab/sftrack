Description: Modern classes for tracking and movement data, building
    on 'sf' spatial infrastructure, and early theoretical work from
    Turchin (1998, ISBN: 9780878938476), and Calenge et al. (2009)
    <doi:10.1016/j.ecoinf.2008.10.002>. Tracking data are series of
    locations with at least 2-dimensional spatial coordinates (x,y), a
    time index (t), and individual identification (id) of the object
    being monitored; movement data are made of trajectories, i.e. the
    line representation of the path, composed by steps (the
    straight-line segments connecting successive locations). 'sftrack'
    is designed to handle movement of both living organisms and
    inanimate objects.
