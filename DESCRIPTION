Description: Movement classes for tracking data and trajectories,
    relying on sf spatial infrastructure. Tracking data are series
    of locations with at least 2-dimensional spatial coordinates (x,y)
    and a time index (t); Sftrack is designed to handle
    movement of both living organisms and inanimate objects. This package 
    introduces classes to handle movement data as well as common functions
    used in tracking studies.
