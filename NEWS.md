# sftrack 0.6.0 (2020--): Time column, converters, and raccoons dataset

* The time column is now of its own `sft_timestamp` class.
* Added converters to and from `adehabitatLT::ltraj`,
  `trackeR::trackeRdata`, and `amt::track_xyt`.
* `amt`, and `trackeR` included as suggests.
* Added 'raccoons' dataset, available as raw data (`data.frame`
  "raccoons"), tracking data (`sftrack` "racc_track"), and movement
  data (`straj` "racc_traj"). Removed old 'raccoon' dataset + updated
  vignettes (with other minor tweaks) + updated documentation.
* Changed 'summary_sftrack' to 'group_summary', and added area
  covered. Fixed counting of NAs in this function.
* `plot.sftraj`: Argument `step_mode` changed to `mode` with more
  flexibility.


# sftrack 0.5.3 (2021-07-01): CRAN update

* Minor bug in `geom_sftrack.sftrack` that caused an error.
* Updated email addresses for 2 authors, including maintainer.


# sftrack 0.5.2 (2020-10-20)

* Clean up for CRAN (DESCRIPTION, version, LICENSE, vignettesâ€¦).
* Added full pkgdown website.


# sftrack 0.5.1 (2020-09-16)

* Patched print error when using numeric time.
* Vignette updates.


# sftrack 0.5 (2020-09-13): Grouping and plots

* Changed from 'burst' name to 'group' name. This includes changing
  `ind_burst` -> `s_group` (single group) and `multi_burst` ->
  `c_grouping` (column grouping). Verbage has also been changed in all
  documentation.
* Relative angle added to `summary_sftrack`, as well as fixing issue
  where absolute angle was calculating 180 from actual angle.
* 'Active_group' were placed back at the column level. This means that
  any row level group does not have an active burst, but a column
  collection of bursts can define which of those groupings are
  'activated'.
* Sort index returns and is an attribute of a column grouping. It is a
  factor that is recalculated everytime something in the data frame is
  changed like a subset or grouping is changed. This is to try to
  bring the sftrack grouping more inline with how `dplyr::group_by`
  works internally. You can access this with `burst_labels` (returns
  the factor) and `burst_names` (get just the `levels()`).
* Plotting is more streamlined in both base plot and ggplot. A
  `step_mode` has been added for sftraj so you can choose to display
  the individual line segments. Although the default is to calculate
  the merged trajectories, which is must faster.
