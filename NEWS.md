## Ver 0.5 (2020-09-13) : Major update.

- Changed from 'burst' name to 'group' name. This includes changing ind_burst -> s_group (single group) and multi_burst -> c_grouping (column grouping). Verbage has also been changed in all documentation.  
- Relative angle added to summary_sftrack, as well as fixing issue where absolute angle was calculating 180 from actual angle.
- active_group were placed back at the column level. This means that any row level group does not have an active burst, but a column collection of bursts can define which of those groupings are 'activated'.
- sort index returns and is an attribute of a column grouping. It is a factor that is recalculated everytime something in the data frame is changed like a subset or grouping is changed. This is to try to bring the sftrack grouping more inline with how  dplyr::group_by works internally. You can access this with burst_labels (return the factor) and burst_names (get just the levels()). 
- Plotting is more streamlined in both base plot and ggplot. A step_mode has been added for sftraj so you can choose to display the individual line segments. Although the default is to calculate the merged trajectories, which is must faster.
