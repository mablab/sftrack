\usage{
step_recalc(x, return = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an sftraj object.}
}
\description{
Step geometeries in sftraj objects are linestrings going from t1 to t2 of a 'step'. As these are stored at the row level they are not dynamic to changes in t2.
step_recalc allows you to recalculate these geometeries if your data.frame has changed because of subsetting or filtering.
