# sftrack: Central classes for tracking and movement data

![sftrack logo](Figures/sftrack-logo-200-transp-bg.png "sftrack logo")

`sftrack` provides modern classes for **tracking and movement data**,
relying on `sf` spatial infrastructure. Tracking data are made of
tracks, i.e. series of locations with at least 2-dimensional spatial
coordinates (x,y), a time index (t), and individual identification
(id) of the object being monitored; movement data are made of
trajectories, i.e. the line representation of the path, composed by
steps (the straight-line segments connecting successive
locations). `sftrack` is designed to handle movement of both living
organisms and inanimate objects.

![data definitions](Figures/definitions.png "data definitions")

The development and design of the `sftrack` package follow three
simple principles:

1. **Minimal and focused:** this is basically the Unix philosophy. Do
   a simple thing, and do it well. The scope of the package is limited
   (see above), with as few dependencies as possible;
2. **User-friendly:** `sftrack` is designed to be as easy to use as
   familiar R structures like `data.frame`s and `sf`
   objects. `sftrack` objects are tidy, and follow the idea that rows
   are records (locations) and columns are variable (following the
   semantics of tracking and movement data);
3. **Flexible and extensible:** `sftrack` is meant first for users to
   use on their data, but also directly designed to address other
   developers' needs for their own tracking packages.


## Getting started

To get started, install `sftrack` from GitHub with the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package:

```r
# To install the stable version
remotes::install_github("mablab/sftrack")

# To install with built vignettes
remotes::install_github("mablab/sftrack", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), build_vignettes = TRUE)

# To install the dev version:
remotes::install_github("mablab/sftrack", ref = "dev")

```

The dev version is updated much more frequently and should pass the
majority of CRAN checks. However, if you install the dev version,
understand it may still contain some bugs. Please submit any bug you
find to the [issues](https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues) page.


## Creating an `sftrack` object

The easiest way to create `sftrack` objects is to start from a
`data.frame` with all information as columns, typically the raw data
extracted from telemetry devices:

```r
library("sftrack")
data(raccoon)
raccoon$timestamp = as.POSIXct(raccoon$timestamp, tz = "EST5EDT")
head(raccoon)

```

```
  animal_id latitude longitude           timestamp height hdop vdop fix
1   TTP-058       NA        NA 2019-01-19 00:02:30     NA  0.0  0.0  NO
2   TTP-058 26.06945 -80.27906 2019-01-19 01:02:30      7  6.2  3.2  2D
3   TTP-058       NA        NA 2019-01-19 02:02:30     NA  0.0  0.0  NO
4   TTP-058       NA        NA 2019-01-19 03:02:30     NA  0.0  0.0  NO
5   TTP-058 26.06769 -80.27431 2019-01-19 04:02:30    858  5.1  3.2  2D
6   TTP-058 26.06867 -80.27930 2019-01-19 05:02:30    350  1.9  3.2  3D

```


In order to convert your raw data into an `sftrack` object, use the
function `as_sftrack()`. The function requires the three main elements
of tracking data:

- coordinates of the locations in at least the `x` and `y` axes (can
  be UTM, lat/long, etc., as provided in `crs`);
- timestamps of the locations as `POSIXct` (*or* as `integer`);
- grouping information (referred to as a "burst"), providing at least the
  identity of each individual.

```r
my_sftrack <- as_sftrack(
  data = raccoon,
  coords = c("longitude","latitude"),
  time = "timestamp",
  burst = "animal_id",
  crs = "+init=epsg:4326")
head(my_sftrack)

```

```

`sftrack` objects can easily be plotted with base R functions:

```r
plot(my_sftrack)

```

## Roadmap

* Submission to CRAN;
* Data class converters from the main tracking packages, such as
  `move::Move` and `trackeR::trackeRdata`, integrated into
  `as_sftrack`;
* More plotting options for tracks and trajectories (in base R and
  `ggplot2`);
* Provide Gantt chart-like or chronogram-like graphs.


## How can you help?

1. **Submit any bug you find to the
   [issues](https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues) page;**
2. Address open questions (see below);
3. Contribute use cases (see below).


### Address open questions: *We need your feedback!*

While the foundations of the package are now pretty solid, we are
still dealing with open questions about several aspects of the
package, including the names of `sftrack` variables (e.g. coordinates,
timestamps, id and error), the structure of the grouping factor, or the
structure of the error term.

If you have strong opinions or simply want to help on the technical
side, we invite you to comment on those [open issues
here](https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/labels/question).


### Contribute use cases: *We need your feedback!*

We also need to precisely understand what is expected from such a
package. The idea here is to collect all possible use cases for a
trajectory object in R. We know they are multiple, and will contribute
our own use cases â€” however, we want `sftrack` to be as useful as
possible, and to act as a center piece for movement in R, so we need
you to tell us how you would use it. **In other words, we want to
understand what you expect from such a package, as a user or as a
developer.** For this, we ask you to fill out special issues in the
GitHub tracker of the package, following the ['Use case'
template](https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=use-case.md&title=%5BUse+case%5D+Change+this+title).

Use cases do not need to be very complicated, but need to present a
specific use in human terms, the technical requirements associated to
it, and the input and output of the use case. Such use case could look
like this:

> **[Use case] Amazing plot for trajectory**
> 
> **Use case:** 
> 
> Plot a trajectory using my `special_trajplot` function, which shows
> [something amazing].
> 
> **Requirements:**
> 
> - spatial coordinates (x,y) as geographic coordinates with
>   projection information
> 
> - a time (t) as POSIXt object, ordered in time
> 
> - information that identifies individuals (e.g. animal) for each
>   location
> 
> - data associated to each location directly accessible
> 
> **Input:**
> a `sftrack` object
> 
> **Output:**
> a plot with [something amazing] about the trajectory
> 
> **Additional information:**
> See my `special_trajplot` function here [with link].

Another example could be like this:

> **[Use case] Fill in missing locations in a sequence**
> 
> **Use case:** 
> Fill in the missing locations of a trajectory that contains spatial or temporal gaps.
> (for instance coming from GPS with failed fixes); In other words
> add in the missing values of a trajectory, i.e. timestamps with no geographic
> coordinates.
> 
> **Requirements:**
> 
> - a time (t) as POSIXt object, ordered in time
> 
> - information that identifies sequences of locations (optional, if
>   several sequences), which could be different circuits of one
>   individual, or different individuals, etc.
> 
> - `sftrack` should be capable of handling/storing missing values
> 
> **Input:**
> a `sftrack` object
> 
> **Output:**
> a `sftrack` object with additional timestamps for gaps (but otherwise
> identical in every way to the original `sftrack`)
> 
> **Additional information:**
> See `adehabitatLT::setNA`, which does exactly that on `ltraj`
> objects.
