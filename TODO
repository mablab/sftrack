* Ideally: Compatibility with `dplyr` (check https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/blob/main/R/tidyverse.R and https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/blob/main/R/tidyverse-vctrs.R). See also: https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues/13
* Use `sfheaders`?
* Compatibility with `|>`
* Check interest of `sftime`, especially for intervals: https://r-spatial.github.io/sftime/articles/sftime.html#user-defined-time-columns
* Check compatibility with `mapview`: https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues/39
* Elements of an 's_group' should be atomic: https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues/32
* Error model: https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues/3
* Differentiate between point-based and segment-based attributes: https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues/6
* 3D coordinates? https://github.com/mablab/sftrack/issues/14
