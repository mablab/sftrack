# The proposal
<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined.

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->

Based on years of experience, and broad feedback from the movement
community, we aim to develop a central trajectory class to support all
stages of movement studies (pre-processing, post-processing and
analysis). We propose a `sftraj` package offering a generic and
flexible approach . The only aim of the package will be to present
this central class and basic functions to build, handle, summarize and
plot movement data. Our project relies on three complementary pillars:
a broad involvement of the movement community, a robust conceptual
data model, and a `sf`-based implementation in R. <!-- ` -->

### Definitions

A *trajectory* can be defined as the (continuous) curve made by moving
objects (Turchin 1998, Fig. 2). In practice, this curve is sampled
(recorded) at discrete times to collect a 4D *location* (vertices
composed of 3-dimensional spatial coordinates plus the temporal
coordinate), which define *tracking data* of the form $(x, y, z, t)$,
or a *track* or *path*, i.e. the "complete spatio-temporal record of a
followed organism, from the beginning to the end of observations"
(Turchin 1998, Biljecki *et al.* 2013).

```{r definitions, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Definition of elements of movement.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/definitions.png")
```

Considering the temporal autocorrelation between successive locations
as part of the movement information (Martin *et al.* 2009), we can
then defines *steps* as the straight-line segments between two
successive locations. Treating movement steps as straight lines is an
"idealization" and the most parsimonious approach (other complex
approaches exist in some fields, such as splines and Bezier curves),
but at sufficient resolution, no significant information is lost.

Movement is thus recorded by a series of locations in a track, and is
abstracted as sequential steps in a trajectory. It is important to
recognize this dual perspective, between tracking data (locations) and
movement data (steps) (Fig. 2).


### Conceptual data model

To organize elements of data and how they relate to one another and to
properties of the real world entities (here a moving object), we
followed the methodology for conceptual modeling of geographic
information that is specified in the International Standards (ISO/TC
211) as described by Roswell (2011), which relies on a standard
conceptual model specified in Unified Modeling Language (UML).

In the proposed model (Fig. 3), a `Location`, i.e. tracking data of
the form $(x, y [, z], t)$ is implemented as an association between a
`Point` (3D spatial coordinates) and a `Time` (temporal coordinate). A
series (collection) of unique and ordered Locations then defines a
`Track`. Two successive Locations also define a `Step`, as the
elementary unit of movement data. A series (collection) of unique and
ordered Steps finally defines a `Trajectory`.

Relationships between entities are not necessary symmetrical. It is
only possible to navigate downwards from Track to Locations, and from
Trajectory to Steps, as all information of a Location, or a Step, is
contained in a Track, or a Trajectory, respectively, but not the other
way around. Similarly, navigation is unidirectional between a Step and
a Location, as two successive Locations are necessary to define a
Step. However, navigation is bidirectional between a Track and a
Trajectory, as it is necessary to enforce direct correspondence of
both objects.

```{r data-model, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "Proposed conceptual model.", fig.align = "center", fig.pos = "!t"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/conceptual-model.png")
```


### Implementation in R

The implementation aims at using existing building blocks as much as
possible, as to not reinvent the wheel, and allow to use existing
tools and functions on these building blocks. We thus propose to base
our classes on simple `data.frame`s using `sf` spatial <!-- ` -->
building blocks. That way, data are provided as tidy data, in a data
frame of observations (rows) and variables (columns). One of the
variables is the `sf_track` or `sf_traj` column, which will store
tracking data (tracks) and movement data (trajectories), respectively
(Fig. 4). The location or step is the elementary observation and
composes each row of the data frame. Ancillary data associated to the
location or the step can be stored as additional variables, some of
them potentially grouping locations or steps into higher units.

```{r implementation, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.cap = "Proposed implementation of movement data in R. Tracking data are essentially similar, but do not have the 'Singletons' attribute.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/implementation.png")
```   

`sf` provides the core spatial classes. Tracking data can be
considered as `POINTS ZM`, i.e. points with longitude, latitude,
altitude, and timestamps. If the exact time of the location is known,
timestamps can be stored as `POSIXct`. Two successive `POINTS ZM`
define a `LINESTRING ZM`, i.e. the straight-line segment between two
successive locations. As the `M` coordinate has been little tested,
its relevance and usefulness will be assessed early in the
project. Alternatively, timestamps will be stored separately from the
geographic data.

Two new classes of `data.frame`s will be define, in order <!-- ` -->
to store tracking data (`c("sftrack", "sf", "data.frame")`) or
movement data (`c("sftraj", "sf", "data.frame")`).  Correspondingly,
the step column (list-column) will be of class `sfc_TRACK` or
`sfc_TRAJECTORY`, with a unique Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and
timezone in the two (constant) attributes `crs` and `timezone`,
respectively. The implementation is further complicated by the fact
that a full correspondence between a *track* and a *trajectory* needs
to be achieved, while there is no bidirectional navigation between a
Location and a Step.  An additional attributes `Singletons`
specifically for `sftraj` will thus contain locations that do not form
a step, i.e. in the case of a location surrounded by two missing
(empty) locations.

A single `sftrack` or `sftraj` object can be a single track or
trajectory, or a set of them, sharing the same attributes (CRS and
timezone). Nesting is an essential part of the data model, as it
allows any relevant boundaries of a trajectory, such as the individual
level, the year, or a journey (movement from home to work and from
work to shopping, Biljecki *et al.* 2013), and any nested combination
of those. The package `tidyr` offers a function `nest`, which allows
to nest columns inside a data frame, and will be used to easily switch
from one level to another (e.g. from an individual representation to
an individual-year representation).

<!-- Finally, ancillary data associated to a step can be constant along the straight-line segment, vary linearly, being aggregated, or being measured at a vertex of the step (typically the start location).  -->
