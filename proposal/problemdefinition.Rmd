Movement defined broadly plays a central role in fields as diverse as
transportation, sport, ecology, music, medicine, and data science
(Gudmundsson *et al.* 2012). As a matter of fact, miniaturized
tracking devices (thanks to global navigation satellite system (GNSS)
and radio-frequency identification (RFID)) have become nearly
ubiquitous, and resulted in an ever-increasing volume of localization
data from very different moving objects, such as humans or animals;
cars, boats or planes; the hand of a musician playing a violin in 3
dimensions; the entire movement of an orchestra or a flock of
starlings; the eye of a person that changes its focus from one object
to the other; etc. Sampling all these movements result in the same
type of data called *tracking data*, in the form of geographic
($x,y,z$) and temporal coordinates ($t$) (Joo *et al.* 2019). Despite
this common nature, there is a critical lack of standard
infrastructure to deal with movement.

While the collection of tracking data is growing on a daily basis, the
use of R for movement studies has also sharply increased, in contrast
to the decline of most other platforms—for instance, in the field of
Movement Ecology, we counted more than 70 % of studies using R in
2018, i.e. roughly three times more than its closest contender, and
the trend is still rising (Fig.1). The movement community in R is at
the same time very dynamic and very fragmented (Joo *et al.* 2019); we
have listed 57 packages that process, visualize and analyze tracking
data, one third of which worked in isolation, not being linked to any
other tracking package. This is in part due to a lack of a modern
infrastructure to deal with trajectory objects in R.

To date, existing classes in R for movement data are either outdated,
relying on outdated standards, or too complicated to be used in a
broad array of situations. Previous attempts notably include the
following classes:

  * `ltraj` (package `adehabitatLT`): Developed as early as 2006, this
    was the first class dedicated to movement that relied on a
    conceptual data model, based on the idea of successive steps,
    i.e. the straight-line segment connecting two successive locations
    (Calenge *et al.* 2009). However, the class itself is largely
    outdated, relying on an *ad-hoc* `list` structure, which is
    complicated to use, requiring to go back and forth between `ltraj`
    and `data.frame` classes frequently.
  * `trip` (package `trip`): Also developed in 2006, `trip` is a S4
    class directly extending `sp`'s `SpatialPointsDataFrame` class to
    connect series of points with a column of timestamps. The
    connection is made through a `TimeOrderedRecords` object that
    identifies which data columns corresponds to timestamps and
    identity of the moving object, making it a lightweight solution,
    however with limited flexibility for nested structures (e.g. split
    individual trajectories into different parts). Also, `sp` has been
    essentially superseded by the more recent package `sf` for spatial
    classes.
  * `Move` (package `move`): Released in 2012, it is a complete S4
    class focusing on animal movement data from the [Movebank
    repository](http://www.movebank.org), but which can also be used
    on any tracking data. However, `Move` objects have a fairly
    complex structure, lack the flexibility of simpler classes, and
    are further arranged into `MoveBurst` (track split into different
    parts) and `MoveStack` (several tracks from different individual)
    classes. Moreover, `Move` objects also relies on spatial classes
    from `sp`.
  * `Track` (package `trajectories`): Released in 2014, this is
    another example of formalizing a movement class as a S4 class,
    following roughly the same logic as described in the package
    `move`, with a complex nested class structure of `Track` objects
    (a single track from one individual), which are combined into
    `Tracks` (several tracks from the same individual) and
    `TracksCollection` (several individuals). `Track` also extend
    spatial classes from `sp`, as well as around the spatio-temporal
    classes from the `spacetime` package.
  * `trackeRdata` (package `trackeR`): More recently released in 2016,
    this package focuses on running and cycling data from GPS-enabled
    tracking devices, and provide a specific class dedicated to
    athlete activity. Similarly to `ltraj`s from `adehabitatLT`,
    `trackeRdata` are lists with locations stored 
    as `zoo` objects (from the package of the same name), which are
    ordered, but not spatial, observations. This *ad-hoc* structure
    makes `trackeRdata` rather complicated to use.

Given the ubiquitous nature of tracking data, the fragmentation of the
ecosystem of R packages dealing with such data, and the difficulty of
use of existing attempts at handling these data, it seems timely and
relevant to address the issue from a data perspective.
